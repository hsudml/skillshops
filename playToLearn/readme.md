# Play to Learn!

## Workshop

__Play to Learn: Game Dev in Unity 3D__ is a 50-minute workshop and game template to teach and learn how to develop games with Unity. The materials included are all CC BY Nathan Spence. 

Nate created the workshop as part of the Humboldt State University [SkillShops](http://humboldt.libcal.com/workshops) series as a [Digital Media & Learning Intern](http://libguides.humboldt.edu/dml/apply) in Spring 2018. The original workshops were offered on [April 18](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4139632) and [April 27](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4139635), 2018.
