# Shooting Video &amp; Recording Audio

## Workshop
__Shooting Video &amp; Recording Audio__ is a 50-minute workshop and handout to teach and learn how to plan out a video project by Jesse Garcia.

Jesse created the workshop as part of the Humboldt State University [SkillShops](http://humboldt.libcal.com/workshops) series as a [Digital Media & Learning Intern](http://libguides.humboldt.edu/dml/apply) in Spring 2018. The original workshops were offered on [April 3](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4048535) and [April 4](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4048537), 2018.

## Handouts
Jesse also works with Access Humboldt and borrowed a [storyboarding worksheet](images/StoryboardAccessHumboldt.jpg) they were gracious enough to let us include in this workshop. 

Jesse developed the guide to be a resource to use when thinking about what types of shots and footage will be needed for a project. The storyboard in the guide can be used as a worksheet to talk about logistics and equipment needs for specific shots. Participants should fill out the storyboard for a scene or two and then discuss their ideas and ask questions about available equipment. 

## Activities
There are no defined activies for this workshop, but facilitators should bring equipment for participants to try out and play with. Depending on the participants' needs and feedback, discussions about setup, locations, lighting and more can be a useful follow-up to introducing the guide. The guide also includes links to more resources and options for projects.
